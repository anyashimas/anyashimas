## Hi! I'm Anna

I'm a senior software developer of 6.5 years and counting, and I'm looking for a job.

I have a strong background in AdTech, but open to something new as well. Looking for full-time/contract job opportunities with the visa sponsorship to move to Japan, UK, or Netherlands.

You'd appreciate me if you'd like someone who's good not only with their hard skills, but with soft ones as well. I am great at managing myself, mentoring other people, taking care of Confluence, tickets, code documentation â€” you pick, I hear project managers love it! You have complicated system? I'm your person, nothing can scare me. Oh, and also, I'm very friendly, including LGBTQA+ friendly.

To be able to offer more, I've recently started learning Java in my free time, but switching to another language won't be a problem if needed.
